- 👋 Hi, I’m @hselig-github, Hendrik Seliger in real life.
- 👀 I’m interested in application if IT, esp. in the TeX context and in data analysis. And I like to extend whatever I am working with: Atom editor, zsh, Gnome environment, you name it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more on Lua.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I am interested in – and where I can actually add value.
- 📫 You can reach me best by dropping a message via GitHub.
